## COMPUTING RESOURCES-PYTORCH
building pytorch in docker,controlling pytorch and jupyter notebooks from virtual machines

topics of pytorch-numeric types,tensors,float precision,object storage of pytorch numeric objects

pytorch optimization:gradient optimization using SGD and using different epoches and leaerning rates.Plotting graphes, detaching axes, using backward propogation, and step changes on optimizer,learnt about Learning rate schedulers,splitting randomly a large dataset,mini batch stochastic gradient, worked with Iris dataset to create datasets objects by slicing it.
